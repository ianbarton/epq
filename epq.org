To what extent does internet censorship In China violate Article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Humans Rights?


In this essay I aim to answer the question ‘To what extent does internet
censorship in China violate article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights?’. I am going to take a balanced view point, taking into consideration
arguments from different points of view, people saying it does violate and
others saying it doesn’t. I will also compare and evaluate if these points are
valid and what I personally believe about them. To start my investigation I am
going to provide and explain some basic definitions surrounding the question. I
also am going to state what has been rumoured to happen and the extent of the
censorship and whether or not this violates the article. I will also back this
up with a real-life case of how it is implemented and the control surrounding
this. I am then going to offer a counter argument of how, as time goes on, there
is less and less being done by the government to control the internet.  To
follow this I am going to explain the culture of self-censorship and how it may
be the people themselves imposing it and therefore not the government. I am
then going to extend this to discuss the citizens that do not censor and find
ways around it and the possible consequences of this. I shall then go on to
detail how the social differences between China and the rest of the world can
be used to defend the implementation of censorship. To further the defence I am
going to find and evaluate the justification given by the Chinese government
itself and see their stand point, more counter points will be provided to
this. I am then going to return to the differences between cultures, debating
whether it has actually been beneficial to the country on a whole as a way to
unite it. I will also briefly talk about how some think the censorship has not
hindered citizens but has partially aided them. Then I shall briefly compare the
censorship in China to that in England. Finally, to conclude I will weigh up
each argument and point and hopefully come to an unbiased standpoint to the
extent the censorship violates article 19. I intend to use a variety of sources
including online journals, websites and books to get varied but valid opinions
and points of view. I am also going to include information from people who have
to live with the censorship as well as people who live in different countries
as they will have a different understanding. This is all to assist in keeping
arguments and points of view balanced.

To fully be able to answer this question we must know that article 19 of The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through any media and regardless of frontiers”. We must also know what internet
censorship actually is and what it entails. To most people internet censorship
is just known as the blocking of websites or the control of explicit content.
Its only use is to protect children from the adult content that is out
there. Nevertheless the extent to internet censorship extends much further than
this. According to the Oxford dictionary censorship is “The suppression or
prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered
obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.” In terms of it
being online however it is said to be restrictions placed on what information
can be publicized or viewed on the internet[ CITATION Wha17 \l 2057 ]. This
could be anything from blocking access to copyrighted information, harmful or
sensitive content, or even the blocking of certain political or religious views
that are being expressed. Internet censorship can also help monitor and control
crime that is carried out through  internet by filtering
websites if malicious software or viruses are detected, though this is often on
a more singular basis rather than on a mass basis. Yet from country to country,
computer to computer what is censored will vary.  There are many different
types of internet censorship and as the internet is continuously growing and
developing more types are being implemented every day. I shall discuss the main
few types, starting with IP Blocking, this is when an IP address is blocked
from being accessed[ CITATION QUI17 \l 2057 ]. This means that if the website
being targeted is in a shared hosting server, all the websites on that server
will be blocked and therefore cannot be viewed. There is also DNS Filtering and
Redirection which is when domain names are not resolved [CITATION QUI17 \l 2057
], so do not give the IP address of the website being accessed, therefore
meaning the user cannot connect to it, or alternatively a false IP address will
be returned once again meaning that the website cannot be accessed or they will
be sent to a different site. Uniform Resource Locator Filtering is another type
of online censorship that scans the URL that has been input for target keywords
regardless of the desired domain name specified[ CITATION QUI17 \l 2057
]. There is also packet filtering which will terminate TCP packet transmissions
when a certain number of keywords are detected within[ CITATION QUI17 \l 2057
]. This means that the person searching this information will not receive the
packets and therefore will not receive the data. The final type of censorship I
am going to mention is connection resets. This is a form used quite
aggressively in the Great Firewall which resets the connections of web
requests, which doesn’t allow the user to access the site, and it can then
block all traffic to the site for a set period of time. All of these methods
are rumoured to be used as part of The Great Firewall to try and stop and
control Chinese citizens from accessing certain information[ CITATION Hof16 \l
2057 ]. This could imply that citizens are not allowed to receive information
and therefore could be seen as breeching article 19.

One well known case of real life internet censorship in China is the censorship
around the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989. An unknown number of Chinese
citizens were gunned down for protesting the advance of the military in the
capital. What is controversial about this is how on the anniversary of the
event each year, words linked to the events are blocked. This is a form of
packet filtering as it detects certain keywords or code words and will not
allow the user to search for these. On Weibo, a popular Chinese social media
sight, it is reported that 118 terms linked to the Tiananmen square massacre
were blocked around the time of its anniversary in 2012[ CITATION Ann13 \l 2057
]. This meant that citizens were unable to post commemoration posts or even
educational accounts of what happened to make younger generations aware of the
rebellions. This in turn suggests that these accounts are being almost covered
up and erasing the pro-democracy protest from history. To me this implies that
citizens are not allowed to impart information without interference. This is
blatant interference because the users are not allowed to speak
freely. Therefore, I think this instance does in fact violate article 19 and as
there are multiple more instances of similar censorship it seems a lot of
information is barred from the public in this way.

In contrast to this there are signs that the tight control and constraints are
becoming more relaxed. Along with topics to do with consumerism, sexuality and
death even some political words which were once censored are not anymore. An
instance of this is how in 2009 Chinese media was allowed to report on the
fifty years of control, or democratic reform as some referred to it as, over
Tibet, whereas previous to this it had not been allowed[ CITATION Jia17 \l 2057
]. This allowed for some sort of recognition of the events on this important
day in history. It has even got to the point where anti-corruption sites have
been set up and expose the wrong doings of officials. For example in 2003 the China
Public Opinion Watching Website revealed the corruption of the Deputy
Mayor of Ji Ning city in Shan Dong province and this then resulted in the
Deputy Mayor being arrested[ CITATION Jia17 \l 2057 ]. This
elucidates the impression that the government is slackening its restrictions on
what people can and can’t post, or search for on the internet. To me this shows
that more freedom is being given to talk about sensitive topics and implies
that steps are being taken to reduce censorship and therefore steps are being
taken to stop the violation of Article 19.  One way the Chinese government
tries to reduce the amount of censoring they have to do themselves is to
encourage self-censorship. They promote a culture of citizens censoring
themselves, so by making individuals think that if they violate what the
government thinks shouldn’t be posted that they will be caught and there will
be consequences. This means that people feel that they have to watch what they
say and then hesitate what to post online and often don’t because they know
there could be ramifications. One small method that this is encouraged is by
giving out self-discipline awards at an award ceremony hosted by the Internet
Society of China for Internet Firms. Although this is a non-governmental
organisation it is supported by government authorities. Allegedly companies are
given an award for censoring within themselves and for not allowing any
taboo information to be on their systems[ CITATION RAN17 \l 2057 ].  This along
with the fact that the Chinese government mandates that companies be
responsible for their public content shifts the responsibility from the
government to companies themselves [CITATION The17 \l 2057 ]. Thus
the companies are the ones doing the censoring themselves instead of the
government. So it could be argued that this does not violate article 19 as they
can still seek, receive and impart information, but they just choose not to. They
would still have the freedom to post these things if they so wanted to. However,
I feel this coercion from the government and other regulatory authorities is
putting pressure on people and I would class this as a type of interference because
it is almost a subtle threat that, if you don’t censor yourself there could be
punishment. Additionally, for there then to be rewards once it is done, I
feel this could be seen as bribery and does show how the government is biased
towards censorship. As censorship is proven to violate Article 19 I feel
the culture of self-censorship also indirectly violates it.  Many Chinese
citizens decide that they don’t want to live with the censorship and so find
circumvention methods to get around it. Many use programs such as UltraSurf,
which uses HTTP Proxy servers and encryption protocols for privacy[ CITATION
Ult18 \l 2057 ]. This allows users to bypass the firewall, while protecting all
of the data that is transferred from third parties. Another popular way to
circumvent blocking is to connect to a VPN(Virtual Private Network), this works
by making the users IP address appear to be that of the VPNs, so it basically
tricks the system into thinking you are somewhere you are not. This means you
can access content from other countries without the filters. I personally used
this method when I travelled to China in 2016, to bypass the firewall so I
could access certain social media sites such as Snapchat and Facebook. This
meant that I was not limited by the firewalls put in place that I
was not accustomed to. Unfortunately, as soon as these sites and methods
are created they are shut down and stopped by authorities, so there is
constantly the creation of more and more ways of circumventing the
censorship. Along with this many internet users use code words to communicate
that won’t be detected by censors. However, once these are discovered they are
added to a list of sensitive words which are blocked[ CITATION RAN17 \l 2057
]. This shows the willingness of many thousands of Chinese citizens who don’t
want to be censored and do not agree with what is being done to them. This does
show that no matter what they do, people will always find a way to voice their opinions
and speak freely. Arguably, it could also show how censorship in China does not
violate article 19 as people still find ways to seek, receive and impart
information regardless.  However, there are serious ramifications for people
that are found using circumvention methods. Although China has not officially
put out a statement regarding the legality of circumventing their censorship, I
am going to explain examples of precedent of China’s authority’s response to
circumvention. One case was in 2017 when a man, Deng Jiewei, was sentenced to
nine months in jail for selling access to a VPN in GuangDong province. Jiewei
was convicted of “Providing software and tools for invading and illegally
controlling the computer information system”[ CITATION Nec17 \l 2057 ]. This
further dissuades people from finding methods to openly voice their opinions
and view sites that the rest of the world has access to. This also shows that
even though the government at large is fairly vague on what is and is not
illegal, as many companies use VPNs for different reasons internally, that
there is a possibility depending on the area, that citizens could be
punished. This in itself will discourage people from trying to circumvent the
censorship, which can be seen as interference and so would violate
article 19. You could also reason that a citizen should not have to go to the
extent to doing something potentially illegal and punishable just so that they
can use the internet freely.  Regardless, it is still arguable that because
citizens have the opportunity to bypass these restrictions and be able to post
whatever they want online. Even Bill Gates, principal founder of Microsoft
Corporation, has said that “The Chinese efforts to censor the Internet have been
very limited. It’s easy to go around it…”[ CITATION Dav10 \l 2057 ]. This
comment shows how one of the greatest software architects disregards the
censorship and makes it appear insignificant. This confounds the point that the
censorship does not limit people and therefore does not interfere with their
freedom of opinion and expression and so does not violate article 19. This does
not take into account all of the people who are not technologically inclined
and would not know that circumvention is possible never mind knowing how to
actually do it.

One argument that many people use to defend censorship is that as China is such
a large and diverse country that censorship is needed to prevent mayhem and
help provide stability to the country. Multiple Chinese news websites pledged
that they would self-censor as it would help to “Maintain social stability, and
promote the building of a socialist harmonious society” [ CITATION Xin06 \l
2057 ]. Another citizen has said that “Trying to make over 50 ethnic groups
into a cohesive whole is a problem unique to china and requires unique measures
that may seem unpalatable to outsiders” [ CITATION RAN17 \l 2057 ]. This shows
another perspective which makes it seem like extra precautions are necessary in
China to prevent social disorder. It does pose the question  "Is it more
important for people to be able to use social media or to keep a stable
society". However, I feel that some of the censorship that is imposed is more
serious than just that and that citizens should be allowed to freely comment
and educate others. Yet it does highlight a serious point where maybe
censorship is necessary in China, whereas it might not be in other
countries. The sheer scale and population of the country does make me tend
to think that some sort of control must be needed, even if it was to
just stop the spread of hate speech, or stop the promotion of terrorism, as I
feel protecting citizens is imperative. Although I agree with this to a
certain extent, I still feel that as it states in article 19 everyone has
the right to information “regardless of frontiers”. It shouldn’t matter that
China is a separate country, this applies to every country and every
human. Therefore I feel this argument is invalid as it applies regardless of
borders. I also feel that because it has such a large and diverse population
 peoples voices may need to be heard even more as there
could potentially be problems within societies that need to be resolved, and
won’t be because censorship doesn’t allow for people to talk about them.  In
June of 2010, China released a White Paper detailing how they justify the
censorship in their country. Along with the some of the arguments I have
previously discussed, like how it stops information that could undermine the
state and its power from being published, the White Paper also documented a slightly
different view. It stated that “Within Chinese territory the internet is under
the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty. The internet sovereignty of China
should be respected and protected”[ CITATION Mic10 \l 2057 ], which I feel is
trying to put across the point that the country of China has its own laws and
if the internet is to be used in its country then it should follow the laws and
regulations which the country has set out. I feel this is a fair point as all
countries have laws that govern the actions of people, so why shouldn’t there
also be laws and restrictions on the internet as this would help stop illegal
activities from happening. It could also help keep order and increase the
security of the space.

Another thing that was insisted upon was the fact that “Chinese citizens fully
enjoy freedom of speech on the internet”[ CITATION Mic10 \l 2057 ], this
alludes that the Chinese government is fully aware of the criticisms of its
system, but it disregards them, as in their opinion the censorship does not
limit people’s freedom on the internet. This therefore implies that from their
point of view they are not violating article 19 as they insinuate that people
have freedom of expression.  As I have previously mentioned, one of the reasons
China attempts to control information on the internet is to try and maintain
social and political stability within the country. However, it has been
suggested that censorship does not just maintain, but actually effects and
almost tries to silence any alternate views to those of the government. This
was demonstrated in late 2017 when, it came close to the 19th party congress, a
meeting of the Communist Party of China. Allegedly, in the lead up to it the
censoring was increased and cultural diffusion was regulated more heavily than
normal. This meant that lots of media including foreign films and television
shows were said to have been removed from pages and streaming
applications. Social media was also apparently more heavily monitored, with any
comments or posts relating to the party congress or political matters [
CITATION Qin17 \l 2057 ]. I feel like this does contradict article 19 as it
does stop people from being able to share their opinions on the party. This
means that all the healthy conversations and debating about different
advantages and disadvantages to political parties or leaders is very important
as it helps educate the public with information that they need to be able to
form judgments. I also feel that they have the right to the information about
who is in control of their country and what decisions they could possibly make
about the place you live in. Even though this may help to prevent rebellions
and calm tensions within the country, I honestly believe that this does not
justify the online silencing of people, who obviously have important and
relevant things to say on these issues.  An alternate issue when discussing
internet censorship in China is that when it is discussed people often forget
the significant cultural differences between where they live and China. Here in
England, censorship is generally seen as limiting and supressing the freedom of
the people under it. Whereas in China it has been suggested that citizens
interpret it differently, that they believe that it is almost a tradition as
there have been alternate types of censorship, not on the internet, since 1949[
CITATION Uni12 \l 2057 ].  This means that the culture there has developed
around the censorship and that many of the people in China will therefore
believe that it is a necessary core part of the internet and they would then
therefore agree that they need it. As a result this could then be interpreted
that they almost encourage the censorship as it protects them and keep them
safe. This could then be debated as a reason for censorship as the majority of
the people affected by it in some form condone it, which could be turned to say
that it therefore does not impose on their freedom of opinion as they are in
favour of it.

To further this point the book ‘The Power Of The Internet In China’ actually
debates whether the internet in China has actually allowed for more activism
than if there was no internet at all. It argues that all of the things that
citizens can now do such as “Web campaigns, signature petitions, outright
verbal protests, and online direct action such as virtual sit-ins and
hacktivism”[ CITATION Guo \l 2057 ] have in the long run actually aided the
fight for more freedom of speech in China and that even though the internet is
restricted it has helped loosen the restrictions put down by the
government. The book then goes on to detail how all of the things created and
aided by the internet are phenomenal and how censorship has only meant that
users found even more creative ways to subvert it. This shows that the people
that live with the censorship actually think in a way that has been beneficial to
them and that it hasn’t interfered too much with their freedom of speech, just
made them think and find different ways to express it.  It may be useful to
think about the censorship in China contextually in the world. This will allow
you to see the extent of the censorship in comparison to what is typical. To do
this I am going to state there is censorship here in the United Kingdom. It
is hard to categorically say what exactly is censored in the UK, as obviously
it is not accessible. At the time of writing this
essay (17/05/18) according to the website ‘Blocked’ out of 22,254,612 websites
tested 656,006 of these sites are blocked in the UK by companies such as
BT-Strict, TalkTalk, BT, O2, EE, Sky, Three and VirginMedia [ CITATION Blo18 \l
2057 ]. These companies block either by opt-in or default filtering that aims
to block harmful content from children such as drugs, alcohol, file sharing,
gambling, pornography, nudity, social networking, suicide and self-harm,
weapons and violence, obscenity, criminal Skills, hacking and web-blocking
circumvention tools[ CITATION Nic13 \l 2057 ]. Some of this is understandable
and justifiable, as it would help protect young children from disturbing content
which they could accidentally access. However, it has been reported that there
is over blocking happening. This is when websites which are not harmful are
being blocked unnecessarily and sometimes without reason. Some of this could be
accidental, such as blocking of sex education sites which could have been
mistaken for something else. Yet it seems that sites have been filtered which
do not fit any of the categories listed above and would not be seen as harmful
such as a feminist’s rights blog [ CITATION Jos14 \l 2057 ] and a Youtube video
filmed by a trucker in Calais that shows refugees desperately trying to sneak
on-board trucks [ CITATION Dav18 \l 2057 ]. As neither of these things break
the law, or would possibly be thought of as breaking the law, this leads me to
believe that some of the censorship could be political. This filtering blocks
people from being able to share their opinions and factual evidence of what is
actually happening. This then leads me on to say that I think there are
censorship cases in the UK which do in fact contradict what is stated in
Article 19. From this you can then gather that the censorship in China might
not actually be that extreme compared to what we are used to. I would then go
further to say that if the country myself doesn’t abide by the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights why should China be expected to?

Overall these pieces of information have shown that internet censorship does
violate article 19 quite considerably. The actual censoring such as IP blocking
and DNS filtering actually prohibit internet users from being able to express
their opinions and their freedom of speech as it does interfere with this. This
is a direct violation of the article. It also does not allow citizens to seek
information which is shown in the Tiananmen Square Massacre example and this
also violates the article. Even though there are a substantial amount of people
that self-censor, there are also a large number who circumvent the censorship
attempts. This just goes to show that there is an opposition to the censorship
from the people who are affected by it. In addition to this the fact that they
could be punished for this, just shows the desire of the people to not be
censored. I feel the fact that circumvention is possible does not sway my
standing as many people will not be able to do this as they won’t know how and
so still will be subject to censorship. I also believe that many censor
themselves, as they are being manipulated by the government and people in power
and are afraid of the consequences. As I result I feel this
pressure is actually interference and so also violates the article. The
argument that the culture and precedent for the amount of control in China,
means that is hard for someone who has always lived without it is difficult to
understand. This is because I will never fully understand what is
actually being done to limit free speech and I would also never know if the
censorship is what helps bind the diverse country together. However, in article
19 it does state that every person should have the right to free speech
“Regardless of frontiers” which suggests that that is irrelevant as China
should be subject to this as is every other country and that everyone should
have this right regardless of whether its country’s stability relies on it. I
also feel that the argument that the internet has helped with activism is
partially invalid, as the censorship has made citizens not able to openly
discuss things that the government has deemed sensitive and has made it hard to
show opinions on things which violates article 19.  The only reason I have
decided it does not fully violate the article is because in recent years
the restrictions have become less and there are certain topics and phrases that
are now allowed, when previously they weren’t. This shows some leniency and
suggests that there may be more change to come to help give people even more
freedom online.
