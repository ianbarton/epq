Intro


To fully be able to answer this question we must know that article 19 of The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through any media and regardless of frontiers.” We must also know what internet
censorship actually is and what it entails. To most people internet censorship
is just known as the blocking of websites, or the control of explicit
content. Its only use is to protect children from the adult content that is out
there. Nevertheless the extent to internet censorship extends much further than
this. According to the Oxford dictionary censorship is “The suppression or
prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered
obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security”. In terms of it
being online however it is said to be restrictions placed on what information
can be publicized or viewed on the internet (What is Internet Censorship?,
2017). This could be anything from blocking access to copyrighted information,
harmful or sensitive content or even the blocking of certain political or
religious views that are being expressed. Internet censorship can also help
monitor and control crime that is carried out through the help of the internet
by filtering websites if malicious software or viruses are detected, though
this is often on a more singular basis rather than on mass. Yet from country to
country, computer to computer what is censored will vary.

There are many different types of internet censorship and as the internet is
continuously growing and developing, more types are being implemented every
day. I shall discuss the main few types, starting with IP Blocking, This is
when an IP address is blocked from being accessed (Quick Guide To Internet
Censorship, 2017). This means that if the website being targeted is in a shared
hosting server, all the websites on that server will be blocked and therefore
cannot be viewed. There is also DNS Filtering and Redirection which is when
domain names are not resolved (Quick Guide To Internet Censorship, 2017), so do
not give the IP address of the website being accessed, therefore meaning the
user cannot connect to it, or alternatively a false IP address will be returned
once again meaning that the website cannot be accessed, or they will be sent to
a different site. Uniform Resource Locator Filtering is another type of online
censorship that scans the URL that has been input for target keywords,
regardless to the desired domain name specified (Quick Guide To Internet
Censorship, 2017). There is also packet filtering which will terminate TCP
packet transmissions when a certain number of keywords are detected within
(Quick Guide To Internet Censorship, 2017). This means that the person
searching this information will not receive the packets and therefore will not
receive the data. The final type of censorship I am going to mention is
connection resets. This is a form used quite aggressively in the Great Firewall
which resets the connections of web requests, which doesn’t allow the user to
access the site, and it can then block all traffic to the site for a set period
of time. All of these methods are rumoured to be used as part of The Great
Firewall to try and stop and control Chinese citizens from accessing certain
information (Hoffman, 2016). This could imply that citizens are not allowed to
receive information and therefore could be seen as breeching article 19.

One well known case of real life internet censorship in China is the censorship
around the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989. An unknown number of Chinese
citizens were gunned down for protesting the advance of the military in the
capital. What is controversial is about this is how on the anniversary of the
event each year, words linked to the events are blocked. This is a form of
packet filtering as it detects certain keywords or code words and will not
allow the user to search for these. On Weibo, a popular Chinese social media
sight, it is reported that 118 terms linked to the Tiananmen square massacre
were blocked around the time of its anniversary in 2012 (Henochowicz,
2013). This meant that citizens were unable to post commemoration posts or even
educational accounts of what happened to make younger generations aware of the
rebellions. This in turn suggests that these accounts are being almost covered
up and erasing the pro-democracy protest from history. To me this implies that
citizens are not allowed to impart information without interference, as this is
blatant interference because the users are not allowed to speak
freely. Therefore, I think this instance does in fact violate article 19 and as
there are multiple more instances of similar censorship a lot of information is
barred from the public in this way.

            In contrast to this there are signs that the tight control and
            constraints are becoming more relaxed. Along with topics to do with
            consumerism, sexuality and death even some political words which
            were once censored are not anymore.

Restructure: An instance of this is how in 2009 Chinese media was allowed to
            report on the fifty years of control, or democratic reform as some
            referred to it as, over Tibet, whereas previous to this had not
            been allowed (Ying, 2017).

This allowed for some sort of recognition of the events of this important day
in history. It has even got to the point where anti-corruption sites have been
set up and expose the wrong doings of officials. For example the China Public
Opinion Watching Website, in 2003, revealed the corruption of the Deputy Mayor
of Ji Ning city in Shan Dong province and this then resulted in the Deputy
Mayor being arrested (Ying, 2017). This therefore elucidates the impression
that the government is slackening its restrictions on what people can and can’t
post or search for on the internet. To me this shows that more freedom is being
given to talk about sensitive topics and implies that steps are being taken to
reduce censorship and therefore steps are being taken to stop the violation of
Article 19.

One way the Chinese government tries to reduce the amount of censoring they
have to do themselves is to encourage self-censorship. They promote a culture
of citizens censoring themselves, so by making individuals think that if they
violate what the government thinks shouldn’t be posted that they will be caught
and there will be consequences. This means that people feel that they have to
watch what they say and then hesitate what to post online and often don’t post
anything because they know there could be ramifications. One small method
thatby which this is encouraged is by giving out self-discipline awards at an
award ceremony hosted by the Internet Society of China for Internet Firms. And
although this is a nongovernmental organisation it is supported by government
authorities. Allegedly companies are given an award for censoring within their
companies and not allowing any taboo information to be on their systems (RAND
Corporation, 2013).  This along with the fact that the Chinese government
mandates that companies be responsible for their public content shifts the
responsibility from the government to companies themselves (Punyakumpol,
2011). This then means that the companies are the ones doing the censoring,
instead of the government, so it could be argued that this does not violate
article 19 as they still can seek, receive and impart information they just
choose not to. They would still have the freedom to post these things if they
so wanted to. However, I feel that this coercion from the government and other
regulation authorities is putting pressure on people and I would class this as
a type of interference, as it is almost a subtle threat that if you don’t
censor yourself there could be punishment. Additionally, for there then to be
rewards once it is done, I feel this is almost bribery and does show how the
government is biased towards censorship, and as censorship is proven to violate
Article 19 I feel the culture of self-censorship also indirectly violates it.

One argument that many people use to defend censorship is that as China is such
a large and diverse country, censorship is needed to prevent mayhem and help
provide stability to the country. Multiple Chinese news websites pledged that
they would self-censor as it would help to “Maintain social stability, and
promote the building of a socialist harmonious society” (Hua, 2006). Another
citizen has said that “Trying to make over 50 ethnic groups into a cohesive
whole is a problem unique to China and requires unique measures that may seem
unpalatable to outsiders” (RAND Corporation, 2013). This shows another
perspective which makes it seem like extra precautions are necessary in China
to prevent social disorder. It does pose the question that is it more important
for people to be able to use Youtube or to keep a stable society. However, I
feel that some of the censorship that is imposed is more serious than just that
and that citizens should be allowed to freely comment and educate others. Yet
it does highlight a serious point, where maybe censorship is necessary to China
whereas it might not be to other countries. The sheer scale and population of
the country does make me tend towards thinking that some sort of control must
be needed even, if it was to just stop the spread of hate speech or stop the
promotion of terrorism, as I feel protecting citizens is imperative. Although
I do agree with this to a certain extent I still feel that as it states in
article 19 that everyone has the right to information “Regardless of frontiers”
it shouldn’t matter that China is a separate country, this applies to every
country and every human. Therefore I feel this argument is invalid as it
applies regardless of borders. I also feel that because it has such a large and
diverse population that this means that peoples voices may even need to be
heard more, as there could potentially be problems within societies that need to
be resolved, which won’t be because censorship doesn’t allow for people to talk
about them.

Many Chinese citizens decide that they don’t want to live with the censorship
and so find circumvention methods to get around it.
